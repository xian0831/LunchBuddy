# CIS 600: Android Programming - Lunch Buddy

## Background
This is backend side project for my CIS 600 at Syracuse University. I have around 3 weeks to finish up the whole project. I chose Node.js + MongoDB over PHP + Mysql becuase I was looking for something that can start running in a short amount of time and the flexibility that MongoDB provided. This is my first 
Node.js + MongoDB + Android SDK. It is a fresh start for me.
## Why build this app?
I have couple years of experience in financial service industry in NYC. From my observation, many individuals have spent long hours at work and commute. 
A lot of them do not want to spend extra time to social after a long day of work. Lunch hours can be the most under utilized time of the day. Spend 45 mins to 1 hour to 
social and have lunch together with new and old friends may be the fun experience. 
## What does this code do?
The server side code provide RESTful service for the Android app via JSON.

Following are some of the module I used for the backend service.

### mongoose - for MongoDB interaction
### passport - for authentication
### express - main framework


## Run the code
This project will run on localhost at port 3000. One can use the following command to start the server.

	node server
